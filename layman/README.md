A sentence parser that identifies subjects and verbs and stores them into memory. Hopefully it will evolve to be smarter. But for now, that will be what it is. 

Hopefully it will be a fully functioning English Interpreter.
Well...probably not.
I mean NLP is such a HUGE problem that it has it's own branch in Computer Science.

But I guess we will see what happens!

## Dependencies:
 * Python 3 (For REPL otherwise python2 will work)

## How to use:
For REPL use:
```
$ ./layman.sh
```
or 
```
$ python3 main.py
```

For file input:
```
python3 main.py -f "pathtofile.txt"
```
